## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've had issues with inheritance in the cascade and correct color rendering. Worked to enhance my understanding of this problem and got it right in this solution. Hadn't worked with the box-shadow property, but I loved :heart: that effect. Got more practice with SCSS and and structuring partitioned files. Really like the approach combined with BEM naming methodology.


### Continued development

Still want to work on my understanding of display modes, positioning, and relative units.
